# CaptionIt
## Inspiration
I was using Snapchat recently and it took me forever to think of a caption worthy enough to label the incredible moments I experience. I decided to create an app to save myself time by simulating my great humor and intelligence to come up with unforgetful captions.

## What it does
Analyzes an image, then based on the results of the analysis it comes up with a cool quote and hashtag for it.

## How we built it
The front-end design was built in Swift to take in an image taken from the camera or photo library. We then used Microsofts Computer Vision API to give us a description of the image, then we touched up the description.

## Challenges we ran into
Figuring out how to get a response from the Computer Vision API
Finding the directory where images are saved
Saving images taken using the camera

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Coming up with this revolutionary and time-saving idea

## What we learned
How Alamofire and SwiftyJSON work under the hood
How to manage files on a phone
To never forget about UX

## What's next for CaptionIt
Getting onto devices to begin giving hilarious and memorable captions to all
# CaptionIt-2
